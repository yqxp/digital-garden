This digital garden is the result of my ongoing exploration of ideas, creativity and knowledge. I would like to express my appreciation to people who have knowledge --- everyone, as every people must have something that I need to learn about. As an old Chinese proverb ‘*三人行，必有我师焉*’ --- with two others, there are for sure teachers for me . 

Also a thank you someone on the internet for establishing this concept of digital garden. This is such an interesting concept that showing how unlimited one's expressivity on the digital age. I hope I could also join this beautiful digital ecosystem and contribute my knowledge as well.
